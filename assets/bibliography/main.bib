abstract = {{This book builds theoretical statistics from the first
        principles of probability theory. Starting from the basics
        of probability, the authors develop the theory of
        statistical inference using techniques, definitions, and
        concepts that are statistical and are natural extensions
        and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for
        first-year graduate students, this book can be used for
        students majoring in statistics who have a solid
        mathematics background. It can also be used in a way that
        stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
        being more concerned with understanding basic statistical
        concepts and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for
        a variety of situations, and less concerned with formal
        optimality investigations.}},
