## 📚 what is this?

a tiny wiki for computer science.  
written in vietnamese, by vietnamese students, for vietnamese learners.

## 🚧 status

we just started. right now we’re writing notes (and solving some exercises) from Bishop’s *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning*.  
it’s early, but we’re building as we go.  

## 🤝 contributing

everyone is welcome. beginner or expert, doesn’t matter.  
don’t aim for perfect—just share what you know. tiny steps add up.
