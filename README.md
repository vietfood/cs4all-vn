# cs4all-vn: Computer Science for Everyone (in Vietnamese) üáªüá≥

[ƒê·ªçc ti·∫øng vi·ªát t·∫°i ƒë√¢y](README_VI.md)

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for **cs4all-vn**, a community-driven project aiming to become a comprehensive, friendly, and accessible Computer Science wiki for Vietnamese students and learners everywhere!

**[Visit the Live Wiki Here!](https://lenguyen1807.github.io/cs4all-vn/)** 

## Current Status

This project is currently **under active development**. We are laying the foundations and starting content creation (beginning with Machine Learning based on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book by Christopher Bishop). We warmly welcome contributors!

## How to Contribute

We believe knowledge is best built together! You don't need to be an expert to contribute. Just do it and I'm really happy that I'm not alone anymore ‚úåÔ∏è.

## Acknowledgments

This project, both in its structure and spirit, draws heavily from and is inspired by the **["How To Scale Your Model"](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book)** project by the team at Google DeepMind.

* We extend our sincere gratitude to Jacob Austin, Sholto Douglas, Roy Frostig, Anselm Levskaya, Charlie Chen, Sharad Vikram, Federico Lebron, Peter Choy, Vinay Ramasesh, Albert Webson, James Bradbury, Reiner Pope, and everyone involved in creating such an insightful resource available at [github.com/jax-ml/scaling-book](https://github.com/jax-ml/scaling-book).
* The website utilizes a Distill-style Jekyll theme originally created by **[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)** and the **Distill team**, which provides the clean and readable format for this wiki. Thank you!

We highly recommend checking out their work, especially if you are interested in scaling large models on TPUs. For academic citation of their work, please refer to the [citation information in their repository](https://github.com/jax-ml/scaling-book?tab=readme-ov-file#citation).
