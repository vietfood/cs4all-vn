## 🚧 Project Status

This project is currently in **active development**. We’re laying the groundwork and starting with content on **Machine Learning**, based on *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher Bishop.

We’re just getting started—and we’re excited to grow with your help!

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We believe that knowledge grows best when shared.

Whether you’re a beginner or experienced developer, you’re welcome to contribute. Don’t worry about perfection—your participation matters, and it means a lot to know we're building this together ✌️

## ♥ Acknowledgments

This project is inspired by the structure and collaborative spirit of the fantastic **[How To Scale Your Model](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book)** by the team at Google DeepMind.

Special thanks to:  
Jacob Austin, Sholto Douglas, Roy Frostig, Anselm Levskaya, Charlie Chen, Sharad Vikram, Federico Lebron, Peter Choy, Vinay Ramasesh, Albert Webson, James Bradbury, Reiner Pope—and all contributors behind this incredible resource: [jax-ml/scaling-book](https://github.com/jax-ml/scaling-book).

The site design is based on a Distill-style Jekyll theme from **[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)** and the **Distill team**, providing a clean and accessible reading experience.

If you’re interested in large-scale ML systems or TPU training, their work is a must-read.
